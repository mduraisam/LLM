### **LLM Lifecycle **

#### **1. Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Description**: Gather and preprocess the data required for training the LLM. This includes collecting relevant text data, cleaning it, and formatting it appropriately.
   - **Key Activities**: Data acquisition, data cleaning, data augmentation.

#### **2. Model Training**
   - **Description**: Train the LLM using the prepared data. This involves selecting the appropriate architecture, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and iterating on the training process.
   - **Key Activities**: Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, training, validation.

#### **3. Evaluation and Testing**
   - **Description**: Assess the model’s performance using various metrics and benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and functionality.
   - **Key Activities**: Performance evaluation, testing with real-world scenarios, A/B testing.

#### **4. Deployment**
   - **Description**: Integrate the trained model into the target environment or application. This includes setting up the infrastructure and ensuring the model is accessible and operational.
   - **Key Activities**: Deployment planning, integration, monitoring setup.

#### **5. Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - **Description**: Continuously monitor the model’s performance in the live environment and update it as needed. This includes handling drift, errors, and updating the model with new data.
   - **Key Activities**: Performance monitoring, error handling, model retraining, updates.

#### **6. Feedback and Improvement**
   - **Description**: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to improve the model. This includes refining the model based on real-world usage and evolving requirements.
   - **Key Activities**: Feedback collection, model refinement, iterative improvements.
